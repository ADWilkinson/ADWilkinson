### Background

Built my first crypto project at ETHGlobal 2021. Joined Set Labs, then spun out **GalleonDAO** to build DeFi structured products — raised a seed round, launched products, weathered the 2022 storm.

Now engineering at **ZKP2P**, building trustless fiat rails. The protocol lets you buy/sell crypto P2P using Venmo, PayPal, Wise — with ZK proofs verifying payments without exposing your data.

On the side: autonomous AI agents ([Barbossa](https://barbossa.dev) ships PRs from your backlog), trading bots, and whatever else catches my interest.

### Philosophy

> Ship beats perfect. Build tools that solve your own problems first.

I like building things that work. Prefer small, composable pieces over monoliths. Heavy user of AI tools — Claude Code is my copilot, Barbossa handles the grunt work.

The nautical theme isn't an accident. Crypto still feels like the open sea: uncharted, risky, full of opportunity for those who know how to navigate.

<details>
<summary>Random Facts</summary>

- The Davy Jones persona started as a joke for GalleonDAO's pirate theme. It stuck.
- First code I ever wrote was a Unity object pooling system — still gets stars occasionally.
- I treat AI agents like junior devs: give clear specs, review their PRs, and let them handle the boring stuff.
- Prefer building in public. Most of my repos are MIT licensed.
